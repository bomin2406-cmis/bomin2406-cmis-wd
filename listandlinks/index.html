				Lists and Links
			<h2>
			<p>
				This assignment focuses on creating a new folder within our repository folder. After creating the folder, these steps help in training ourselves with how to create files within the folder, and also with adding list of instructions (and codes for them: ul for unordered list and ol for ordered list). Through this assignment we are also able to learn how to add links to our site. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.</li>
				<li>Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"</li>
				<li>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.</li>
				<li>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.</li>
				<li>In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.</li>
				<li>In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".</li>
				<li>Add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements.</li>
				<li>Turn in your work.</li>
